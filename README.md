## Intro

This is a simple judge system. Only supports NCCU-ghost(ghost.cs.nccu.edu.tw) currently.  
Planning on making this a website version since we still need more SQL and html techniques.  

### 1keyencrypt

1keyencrypt is a C++ compiled executable using [crypt(1)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/816-5165/crypt-1/index.html) and [MD5 package from OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/MD5_Init.html).  
The program uses the date to generate a special key, which will later be used on encrypt input files.

1. Get MD5 hash of the input date.  
2. Take the first 8 digits of 
```
