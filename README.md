# C.D\_Judge

This is a simple C language judge system.  
Only supports on NCCU-ghost(ghost.cs.nccu.edu.tw) currently.  
Created by [CTHua](https://github.com/CTHua) & [Dark9ive](https://github.com/dark9ive).  

## Get started

Step 1. Clone the project to your own directory using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/CTHua/C.D_Judge.git
```

Step 2. Change directory into the cloned folder:

```
cd ./C.D_Judge
```

Step 3. Compile necessary files:

```
make
```

## Usage

### WARNING:   

__This project is NOT designed for general user and IS NOT EXPECTING ANY ONE EXCEPT DEVELOPERS TO EXECUTE!!__  
__Running these compiled executable files may CAUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR PERSONAL FILES!!__  
__SO MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!__  
__DO EVERYTHING AT YOUR OWN RISK!!__  

### Ganerate encrypted input/output files

You must encrypted your i/o file(s) with following commands:  

```
1keycrypt test_date(YYYYMMDD) num_of_question(s)
```

### Submit answers

Please make sure that you are in the same directory with your "main.c", then type:

```
/home1/student/stud108/s10829/judge/submit test_date(YYYYMMDD)
```

## Intro

This is a simple judge system. Only supports NCCU-ghost(ghost.cs.nccu.edu.tw) currently.  
Planned on making this a website version since we still need more SQL and HTML techniques.  

###	hash.h

__hash.h__ is a C++ source code using [crypt(1)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19253-01/816-5165/crypt-1/index.html) and [MD5 package from OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/man3/MD5_Init.html).  

This file includes only one function, which can __make a hash__ by giving a char array, then return the hash in another char array.  
The Key is generated by the following process:

1. Get MD5 hash of the input string.  
2. Transform the 128-bit hash result into 16 characters(8 bits per character).  
3. Take the first 8 digits of the transformed characters as the encrypt key.  
4. If there is any null byte (0x00) in the key, change it to 0x01.  

### 1keycrypt
  
__1keycrypt__ is the C++ compiled executable of 1keycrypt. See further introduce [below](https://github.com/CTHua/C.D_Judge#cryptcpp).  

### crypt.cpp

__crypt.cpp__ is a C++ source code including [hash.h](https://github.com/CTHua/C.D_Judge#hashh).  
The program uses the date to generate a special key, which is used on __encrypting test files.__  

After the key is generated, the script will then encrypt the test data (input) and Answer (output) files using _crypt_ command.  
  
Although __crypt(1)__ is considered not secure enough, we still use it as our encrypt tool because of its convienience. Plus, the key is hard to be brute-forced since there are about 2<sup>64</sup> combinations in total, and the examinees may only know that the key has something to do with the date. Despite of that, we still planned to add a feature of letting the user to set their own password rather than bind it with the date.  

### submit

__submit__ is the C++ compiled executable of public\_judge. See further introduce [below](https://github.com/CTHua/C.D_Judge#public_judgecpp).

### public\_judge.cpp

__public\_judge.cpp__ is a C++ source code including [hash.h](https://github.com/CTHua/C.D_Judge#hashh).  
  
The judge will do these before grading your code:  

1. Make a ".judge" folder under your current directory.
2. Make a copy of your code into ./.judge and compile it.
3. Make a copy of your code to admins' folder.
4. record submit time

And then start the grading process:  

1. If fails to read the compiled executable, gives CE(Compilation Error).
2. Run the exectable. If runtime stays over 1 second, kill it with signal 9.
3. If the exit code is 137 (kill signal 9), gives TLE(Time Limit Exceed).
4. Other non-zero exit code, gives RE(Runtime Error).

## Submission status

Please visit our [website](http://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/~s10829/index.html) for current submission status.

## Planned feature(s)

 - Custom password for each encryption.
 - Website version(account create, identity verify, db management, etc...)
